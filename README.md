# MTG Legacy UB Tempo Guide

[Link to the Guide](guide.md)

EARLY DRAFT, UNDER CONSTRUCTION

UB Tempo is a strong and fun MTG Legacy deck but hard to play and get good with.
Playing a lot certainly helps especially with experience playing other tempo decks but I believe a more structured learning process and community cooperation helps getting better faster.
In the current day and age most of the discussion happens on sites like Discord and Reddit which are not optimized for cooperative knowledge sharing so as I'm comfortable with GitHub I will try it here.
This guide is inspired by the excellent but currently unmaintained Delver Bible by Bob Huang.

## Future Work

* almost everything (I just started :-))
* card images
* choose a license

## Accessibility and Viewing Formats

The guide should be accessible to everyone, e.g. if you don't see well it should work with a screen reader, please tell us if there are problems we can fix.
I will start with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and probably keep it that way, trying to include card images as well.
In the end I would like to have a web version (trivial with Markdown) and maybe a PDF version as well but right now I'm figuring out how to start and how to structure everything, which formats to use and so on.
Ebook formats like EPUB would also be nice in case someone wants to read this on the beach.

## Contribute

Feel free to request topics that you feel are lacking as an [issue](https://github.com/KonradHoeffner/tempoguide/issues).
If you are an experienced tempo player, you can also contribute directly with a GitHub account.

Current contributors: Ecobaronen, kirdie.

## Licensing

This guide is free for everyone to read but should not be redistributed for profit.
There won't be any ads or other ways of making money with this, it is purely for sharing knowledge and I spend my time on it for free.
However I did invest money into getting expert contributions so I won't complain if someone paypals me a few â‚¬ to share that and get more contributions in the future :-).
