# MTG Legacy UB Tempo Guide

EARLY DRAFT, UNDER CONSTRUCTION

UB Tempo is a strong and fun MTG Legacy deck but hard to play and get good with.
Playing a lot certainly helps especially if you have experience with other tempo decks but as in lots of other areas in life I believe a more structured learning process and community cooperation helps getting better faster.
In the current day and age most of the discussion happens on sites like Discord and Reddit which are not optimized for cooperative knowledge sharing so as I'm comfortable with GitHub I will try it here.

## Accessibility and Viewing Formats

The guide should be accessible to everyone, e.g. if you don't see well it should work with a screen reader, please tell us if there are problems we can fix.
In the end I would like to have a web version and maybe a PDF version as well but right now I'm figuring out how to start and how to structure everything, which formats to use and so on.

## Contribute

Feel free to request topics that you feel are lacking as an [issue](https://github.com/KonradHoeffner/tempoguide/issues).
If you are an experienced tempo player, you can also contribute directly with a GitHub account.

## Licensing

This guide is free for everyone to read but should not be redistributed for profit.
There won't be any ads or other ways of making money with this, it is purely for sharing knowledge.
I haven't chosen an exact license yet but if you contribute you should accept this general idea.
