# MTG Legacy UB Tempo Guide

[Link to the Guide](https://konradhoeffner.github.io/tempoguide/)

EARLY DRAFT, UNDER CONSTRUCTION

UB Tempo is a strong and fun MTG Legacy deck but hard to play and get good with.
Playing a lot certainly helps especially with experience playing other tempo decks but I believe a more structured learning process and community cooperation helps getting better faster.
In the current day and age most of the discussion happens on sites like Discord and Reddit which are not optimized for cooperative knowledge sharing so as I'm comfortable with GitHub I will try it here.
This guide is inspired by the excellent but currently unmaintained Delver Bible by Bob Huang.

## Future Work

* almost everything (I just started :-))
* better card images
* choose a license
* ebook version

## Accessibility and Viewing Formats

The guide should be accessible to everyone, e.g. if you don't see well it should work with a screen reader, please tell us if there are problems we can fix.
I will start with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and probably keep it that way, trying to include card images as well.
In the end I would like to have a web version (trivial with Markdown) and maybe a PDF version as well but right now I'm figuring out how to start and how to structure everything, which formats to use and so on.
Ebook formats like EPUB would also be nice in case someone wants to read this on the beach.

### Writing Style and Grammar

To ensure the guide remains easy to read and understand for experienced and new players alike, please make sure your contributions meet a basic standard of grammatical correctness, capitalization and clarity.

**❌ Bad Example:**
> murk > goyf cause its not pushable, otoh murk is blast foddder an goyf owns against aggro

**✅  Good Example:**
> In the current meta I prefer Murktide Regent in the main over Barrowgoyf because Murktide Regent is immune to Fatal Push.
> On the other hand, Murktide Regent dies to Pyroblast and Barrowgoyf stabilizes extremely well against aggro decks, though if red-based aggro decks ever take over the meta this recommendation may change.

**Too much**
> In this tumultuous, ever-shifting strategic paradigm we call the meta, I have cast aside the terrestrial brute, the humble Barrowgoyf, and instead pledge my fealty to the magnificent, the ethereal, the truly transcendent Murktide Regent as my primary champion...

## Licensing

This guide is free for everyone to read but should not be redistributed for profit.
There won't be any ads or other ways of making money with this, it is purely for sharing knowledge and I spend my time on it for free.
However I did invest money into getting expert contributions so I won't complain if someone paypals me a few € to share that and get more contributions in the future :-).
