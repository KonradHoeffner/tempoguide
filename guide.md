Eco on the red splash:
> I want to splash red if I go to Italy and play paper.
> Haha. I loved this splash when Show and Tell and Stock Ups were heavily played. Let’s say Painter became a 15% deck, then I would love Meltdown as well.



## Comparison to red-based Delver decks

Red-based Daze decks with Delver or Cori-Steel Cutter are more explosive and kill faster, have reach through Lightning Bolt and bring powerful red sideboard cards like Pyroblast and Meltdown.
UB Tempo is slower, has a more stable manabase, can go longer through card advantage with Tamiyo and can kill high toughness creatures easier with black removal spells.

## Card Choices

### Manabase


### Core Cards

#### Fatal Push
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Fatal+Push&format=image&version=small">
Kills most relevant creatures in Legacy, so play 4.

#### Murktide Regent vs Barrowgoyf
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Murktide+Regent&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Barrowgoyf&format=image&version=small">

Murktide Kills faster against combo and control but Barrowgoyf stabilizes extremely well. Murktide is immune to Fatal Push but dies to Pyroblast.

#### Brazen Borrower
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Brazen+Borrower&format=image&version=small">

Can bounce stuff that Fatal Push doesn’t hit, like Murktide Regent, Chalice of the Void, Ensnaring Bridge, Marit Lage, a flipped Tamiyo and much much more. While bounce is less powerful than removal in a vacuum, UB doesn’t have flexible 2 mana removal spells like Molten Collapse or Witherbloom Command, so this is currently our best option. Maybe Wizards will print a UB command in the future?

#### Ponder / Brainstorm
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Ponder&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Brainstorm&format=image&version=small">

Core cantrips, 4 of each are required, but I sometimes board out a Ponder.

#### Kaito, Bane of Nightmares
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Kaito, Bane of Nightmares&format=image&version=small">

Formerly niche card but since the Frog ban firmly established as a two of value engine that is hard to remove and can disable creatures like Murktide Regent or even Emrakul.

<!--
A bit expensive but great against control and also in fair matchups that don’t swarm with creatures, so it feels more widely applicable than Court of Cunning and other anti-control cards.
As it can tap Elvish Reclaimer and a Marit Lage created on the opponents turn and  is immune to Maze of Ith, it also feels useful against lands as long as you get to 3 mana.
2UB, 4 Loyalty: too expensive but we usually use the Ninjutsu 1UB: Preferably return a Nethergoyf or Tamiyo to your hand to put it directly into play, bypassing countermagic. As this deck is low on lands and uses Wastelands for tempo, 2UB is too much so you hardcast it. On MTGO, make sure to enable stops in your block (if you prefer to hit for 3) and combat damage phases (if you want to hit for more) so you won’t miss your window to use this!
During your turn, Kaito is a 3/4 creature with hexproof. Together with the -2, this static ability makes him extremely hard to be killed by opponents who don’t swarm the board with creatures. Other than getting attacked, the only common ways to remove him are REB, Brazen Borrower, Leyline Binding, Prismatic Ending for 4, Sheoldreds Edict, Teferi + Sweeper, Brainstorm + Terminus.
+1: Get an emblem giving all your Ninjas +1/+1. It only buffs Kaito but it stacks and if you always use it, he does 3/8/14/20 damage cumulatively.
0: Surveil 2, then draw a card if an opponent lost life this turn, Draws cards and the surveil helps Nethergoyf, Frog, Murktide, Counterbalance (if you keep both) and Tamiyo -3. 
-2: Tap target creature and put a stun counter on it. If the opponent has only one creature, you can 4->2->3->1->2->0 and tap it for 6 turns after which Kaito dies and you did 21 damage.

### Niche Cards
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Dauthi Voidwalker&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Baleful Strix&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Stock Up&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Hymn to Tourach&format=image&version=small">

Eco:

* Dauthi Voidwalker: I like this card because it’s never a bad draw and some decks HAVE to remove it. You have to play this on TOP of your normal graveyard hate because it doesn’t let you keep more hands vs. Oops.
* Stock Up: If the format slows down significantly, we can play this card. For example if Beanstalk becomes a good deck.
* Baleful Strix: Same philosophy. If we have to play a lot of mirrors and grindy matchups, Strix is good.
* Hymn to Tourach: Time has mainly passed on this card. I think decks like Show and Tell would have to be 20% of the metagame for Hymn to be good. These days, we have to play to the board a lot.
* 2nd Sewers: If you play a slightly bigger version with 20 lands, I like 2nd Sewers.

## Sideboard

Eco:

* Hydroblast: Look at combined amount of Moon, Sneak (not Omni), red Daze, red Painter and red Storm. I’ll play 0-2 copies depending on the metagame share.
* Consign to Memory: After Eldrazi’s ban, this is mainly a hatecard for Mystic Forge. It also helps vs. Painter, Lands and D+T, so the combined amount of those + Forge is what you need to think about. 
* Cursed Totem: This card is viable if your metagame has both Cradle Control, Breakfast and Bant Nadu - maybe with some bad decks like Goblins (Skirk Prospector) or oldschool D+T (Mother) mixed in. Two mana is a lot for a niche card.
* Counterbalance: I liked this card quite a bit in Izzet where you also have Chaneller to manipulate your top card. Furthermore, Dimir has a wider range of MV which makes Counterbalance less reliable for the cheap MVs. We also want to fetch swamp sometimes (Izzet plays 0 mountains), so UU is rough.
* Damping Sphere: Maybe some combination of 12-post, Forge and Storm can warrant this card.
* Engineered Explosives: I mainly view this as Chalice removal that can randomly kill Rhinos, Constructs or Empty goblins.
* Force of Negation: Great card to fight Show and Tell, Chalice, Forge, Storm and other combo decks. Always worth 2 slots for me.
* 1B removal: My current favorite is Edict which can kill walkers (mainly Tamiyo and Karn, but also against bad decks with Teferi and Narset) and doesn’t give bonus to Nadu. It sometimes can’t kill the Murktide on the field which is a shame. The other ones have to do with the amount of Voidwalker/Bombardier/Brazen vs. Dreadnought/Painter/Constructs in your meta.
* Harbinger of the Seas: I love this card. It punishes bad manabases out of control, Breakfast and Sagas (not for long). 

* Graveyard hate: Online, I like focusing on graveyard hate that lets me keep hands on the draw vs. Oops (Faerie, Surgical, Leyline). In paper, you can play your Cages to have crossover against Zenith.
* Null Rod: Great card these days. Mystic Forge is top8’ing every week, and Oops’ sideboard plan is now Belcher. It also beats bad Storm decks.
* Pithing Needle: This is a good one that will always find a use. Saga, Nomad, Ring, Lands etc etc. It’s often good deckbuilding to play it.
* Spell Pierce/Flusterstorm: I don’t like the one-mana counters because they force me to hold up mana. Every mana unused in today’s Magic gets you closer to losing. Forces, Daze and Thoughtseize will cover for me.
* Subtlety: If the metagame was heavy Oops AND had a stompy deck with Cavern, I like this card.
* Thoughtseize: Playing 4th Thoughtseize in the sideboard will often be bad deckbuilding. It’s fine in a lot of places, but will never shine enough to warrant a sideboard slot. If you like it, play 4 in the main.
* Toxic Deluge: Combination of Cradle, D+T, Bant Nadu and some Energy in your metagame, and you can play this.
* Tsabo’s Web: As you mentioned, heavy amount of Lands with a shift back to Rishadan Port is what you need.

## Clock Management

Eco:
Playing fast is important because it lets you slow down and take your time with hard, game-deciding decisions.
Practice your Ponders, land drops, short cuts and using F6 at strategic moments where you don't give up bluff equity.
It's the same in paper; play fast (and make your opponent play fast as well using the judge) from turn 1 of the game.
We should not cheat with slowplay and then when game two finishes with 8 minutes on the clock start playing fast there.


## Play Patterns

### Shrinking and Growing Creatures

<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Nethergoyf&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Barrowgoyf&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Murktide+Regent&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Nihil+Spellbomb&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Dragon's Rage Channeler&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Orcish+Bowmasters&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Undercity+Sewers&format=image&version=small">

Both UB tempo and many other meta decks have lots of variable-sized creatures, mostly related to card types in the graveyard.

Examples:

* Nihil Spellbomb + Orcish Bowmasters kills Nethergoyf
* Nihil Spellbomb + Murktide Regent + Orcish Bowmasters kills Barrowgoyf
* Nihil Spellbomb + ground blocker kills a formerly delirious Dragon's Rage Channeler
* grow Murktide with second Murktide, Nihil Spellbomb, Faerie Macabre or Tamiyo -3

Undercity Sewers can be a hail mary to hope for a favorable flip or you may even guarantee it with a Brainstorm.

### Threats First or Later

<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Thoughtseize&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Ponder&format=image&version=small">
<img src="https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=Nethergoyf&format=image&version=small">

If you come from a control background you probably prefer to set up with cantrips early but early threats can snowball the game much better, especially Tamiyo.
Of course this heavily depends on the matchup, for example vs Oops your best T1 play is Nihil Spellbomb and your second best is Thoughtseize.
If you are on a single blue source, think about how probable it is that you get Wastelanded depending on what the opponent shows you.
Orcish Bowmasters are often better later in Bowmaster mirrors but against decks with no removal like Show and Tell mainphasing it as early as possible is often good.

## Matchups


### UB Reanimator
TODO


### Oops All Spells
TODO

### 



### Hybrid Decks

Eco:

Breakfast / Tempo DD / Reanimator sideboarding:
These decks are good because they ask tough questions of their opponent.
Against Breakfast, I don’t bring in graveyard hate any more (keeping Nihil is good) because every card in my deck is good against them.
Thoughtseize, Push, Force, Bowmasters. Tempo DD with Tamiyo, Barrowgoyf and Murktide, I’ll have removal spells for + Forces.
Reanimator is the same logic; graveyard hate, removal spells and Forces.


### Doomsday

Eco:

Vs Doomsday you should look for Personal Tutors, Cabal Rituals and 2nd green cycler+2nd Street Wraith.
If they have those, they are focused on Combo.
If they have creatures, you can trim a Wasteland and not bring in Consign. 

### Red Daze Decks

Eco:

Black Daze vs. Red Daze is a cool matchup where they fold to a lot of your cards.
Play the matchup some more, and you’ll win more games for sure.
Focus on stopping aggression and accepting Daze instead of falling behind too much.
Sometimes we can respect Daze, but if you respect it too much, you will get run over.
Build basics if possible.
